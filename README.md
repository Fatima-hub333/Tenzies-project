For a new, fun addition, break out the Tenzi Dice Game during the next family game night. This fast-paced game is enjoyable and very simple to learn. The Tenzi Carma game is recommended for adults or children. The game can be played with two to four players. The object of the dice game is to get all 10 of your dice to show the same number. There is a rule book included with the game, but the fun part of this product is it allows for creativity. Create new rules, or make up your own games with these neon-colored dice. Another ideal use for the Tenzi dice is to use them in other board or card games, if needed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
